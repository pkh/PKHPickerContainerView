PKHPickerContainerView
======================

PKHPickerContainerView is a UIView subclass that includes a UIPickerView with a navigation bar placed on top. This container view is designed to slide up from the bottom of the screen like the keyboard. It is written all in code and Interface Builder is not used.

PKHPickerContainerView was originally written in Xcode 4.5.2 and uses ARC.

## Installation

There are only two files to add to your project:

- PKHPickerContainerView.h
- PKHPickerContainerView.m

Once you have both added to your project, import the header file into the view controller you wish to use it in:

```objective-c
#import "PKHPickerContainerView.h"
````
