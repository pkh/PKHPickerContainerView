PKHPickerContainerView
======================

A simple UIView subclass to display a UIPickerView with accompanying navigation bar with keyboard-like hide/show animations.

PKHPickerContainerView was originally written in Xcode 4.5.2 and uses ARC.

## Installation

There are only two files to add to your project:

- PKHPickerContainerView.h
- PKHPickerContainerView.m

Once you have both added to your project, import the header file into the view controller you wish to use it in:

```objective-c
#import "PKHPickerContainerView.h"
````
